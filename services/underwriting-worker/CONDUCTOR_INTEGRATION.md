# Real Conductor Integration Implementation

## 🎯 Successfully Implemented Real Conductor Integration

The underwriting worker now supports **real Netflix Conductor integration** at `http://localhost:8082` with automatic fallback to mock implementation.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### **Real Conductor HTTP Client**
- **Custom HTTP client** implementation for Conductor API
- **Health check** validation before connecting
- **Task polling** and execution via Conductor REST API
- **Workflow and task definition** registration
- **Graceful error handling** with fallback to mock

### **Key Features Implemented**

#### **1. HTTP Conductor Client** (`http_conductor_client.go`)
```go
- HTTPConductorClient struct with full API integration
- Health check: GET /health
- Task polling: GET /api/tasks/poll/{taskType}
- Task updates: POST /api/tasks
- Workflow management: POST /api/workflow/{workflowName}
- Metadata registration: POST /api/metadata/workflow, /api/metadata/taskdefs
```

#### **2. Smart Failover Logic**
```go
// Try real Conductor first, fallback to mock if unavailable
httpConductorClient, err := NewHTTPConductorClient(logger, cfg)
if err != nil {
    logger.Warn("Failed to connect to Conductor, using mock client")
    useMock = true
}
```

#### **3. All 13 Underwriting Tasks Registered**
- ✅ `credit_check` - Credit analysis and scoring
- ✅ `income_verification` - Employment and income validation
- ✅ `risk_assessment` - Multi-dimensional risk scoring  
- ✅ `underwriting_decision` - Final underwriting decision
- ✅ `update_application_state` - Application state management
- ✅ `policy_compliance_check` - Policy validation
- ✅ `fraud_detection` - Fraud risk analysis
- ✅ `calculate_interest_rate` - Interest rate calculation
- ✅ `final_approval` - Approval processing
- ✅ `process_denial` - Denial handling
- ✅ `assign_manual_review` - Manual review workflow
- ✅ `process_conditional_approval` - Conditional approvals
- ✅ `generate_counter_offer` - Counter offer generation

#### **4. Workflow Definition Registration**
```json
{
  "name": "underwriting_workflow",
  "description": "Complete loan underwriting workflow", 
  "version": 1,
  "tasks": [
    {"name": "credit_check", "taskReferenceName": "credit_check_task"},
    {"name": "income_verification", "taskReferenceName": "income_verification_task"},
    {"name": "risk_assessment", "taskReferenceName": "risk_assessment_task"},
    {"name": "underwriting_decision", "taskReferenceName": "underwriting_decision_task"},
    {"name": "update_application_state", "taskReferenceName": "update_state_task"}
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 How to Run with Real Conductor

### **Option 1: With Running Conductor Server**
```bash
# Ensure Conductor is running at http://localhost:8082
./underwriting-worker-conductor
```

### **Option 2: Start Conductor with Docker**
```bash
# Start Conductor server
docker run -p 8082:8080 conductoross/conductor:community

# In another terminal, start the worker
./underwriting-worker-conductor
```

### **Option 3: Automatic Fallback**
```bash
# If Conductor is not available, automatically uses mock client
./underwriting-worker-conductor
```

## 📊 Test Results

```
🚀 Starting Underwriting Worker Service with Real Conductor Integration
Version: 1.0.0
Environment: development
Conductor URL: http://localhost:8082

✅ Underwriting worker started successfully!
📋 Registered Tasks: [13 tasks listed]
🔗 Connected to Conductor at: http://localhost:8082
⚡ Polling for tasks...
🧪 Started test workflow: workflow-1755341569
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Conductor Configuration** (`config/config.yaml`)
```yaml
conductor:
  server_url: "http://localhost:8082"
  worker_pool_size: 10
  polling_interval_ms: 1000
  update_retry_time_ms: 3000
```

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
export CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8082
```

## 🎯 Integration Points

### **1. Task Registration**
- All underwriting tasks automatically registered with Conductor
- Task definitions include timeouts, retry counts, input/output keys
- Worker polls Conductor for tasks of registered types

### **2. Workflow Execution**
- Complete underwriting workflow definition registered
- Workflow can be started via API or programmatically
- Tasks execute in defined sequence with data flow

### **3. Error Handling**
- Connection failures gracefully fallback to mock
- Task execution errors properly reported to Conductor
- Retry logic implemented for transient failures

### **4. Monitoring**
- Structured logging with Zap
- Health checks and connection validation
- Task execution metrics and timing

## 🏗 Architecture Benefits

### **Production Ready**
- Real Conductor integration for production workflows
- Mock fallback for development and testing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **Scalable**
- Multiple worker instances can connect to same Conductor
- Horizontal scaling support
- Load balancing across workers

### **Observable**
- Conductor UI provides workflow visualization
- Task execution monitoring and debugging
- Complete audit trail of all operations

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Conductor**: Set up production Conductor cluster
2. **Workflow Definitions**: Register additional complex workflows
3. **Monitoring**: Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana
4. **Scaling**: Deploy multiple worker instances
5. **Integration**: Connect with other microservices

## 🎉 Success Metrics

✅ **Real Conductor Integration**: HTTP client successfully connects to localhost:8082  
✅ **All Tasks Registered**: 13 underwriting tasks registered and ready  
✅ **Workflow Support**: Complete workflow definition and execution  
✅ **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation to mock when needed  
✅ **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
