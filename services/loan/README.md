curl http://localhost:8080/v1/loans/health
```

### Metrics Endpoints
- Application statistics: `GET /v1/loans/stats`
- Workflow status monitoring via Conductor UI

## Production Considerations

1. **Database**: Replace MockRepository with actual PostgreSQL implementation
2. **Authentication**: Implement proper JWT authentication middleware
3. **Conductor**: Deploy Netflix Conductor for workflow management
4. **Monitoring**: Add Prometheus metrics and distributed tracing
5. **Logging**: Configure centralized logging with ELK stack
6. **Security**: Implement rate limiting and input sanitization
7. **Caching**: Add Redis for performance optimization

## Contributing

1. Follow Go coding standards
2. Add tests for new features
3. Update translation files for new messages
4. Document API changes
5. Ensure backwards compatibility
